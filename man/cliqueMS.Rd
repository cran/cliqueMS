\title{'cliqueMS' annotates isotopes and adducts in m/z data}
\description{
'cliqueMS' first separates features in the data into different
groups. To do this it computes a similarity weighted network
from the data, and searches clique groups. This cliques are
fully connected components that have higher similarity in
inner edges than edges outside cliques.

Once clique groups are computed, annotation of isotopes is
first performed. After isotope annotation, adducts are
annotated within each group
