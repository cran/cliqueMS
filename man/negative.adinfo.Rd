\title{Default list of negative charged adducts}
\format{This is a dataset of 11 rows and 5 columns,
corresponding to 11 different adducts.
Column 'adduct' contains adduct names, column
'log10freq' contains the log10 frequency of that
adduct in the list, column 'massdiff' contains the
mass difference of that adduct, column 'nummol'
has the number of molecules of that adduct and
column 'charge' has the charge of that adduct.}
\usage{
negative.adinfo
}
\description{
This is a sorted list of adducts ordered by
adducts with charge < -1, adducts with charge = -1
and number of molecules = 1, and adducts with
number of molecules > 1. Each of the tree groups
of adducts is sorted from smaller to bigger
mass difference
